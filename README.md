What do you do when you're sad?

Sits and cries? 

Listens to sad, grieving music?

Plays something and becomes the most toxic player?

Do you know what **I** actually do?

I motherf*ckin look at dogs with eyebrows. Is there anything better than this? (Spoiler: there isn't, don't even try)

## What is this shit

This shit is a goddamn Ruby (a red and nice programming language) script that uses Google Custom Search Engine and Google JSON Custom Search API. You can download as many nice and cutey dogs as you goddamn want, man. What are you waiting for? Let's do this shit.

## How can I do this shit

Nice and easy, man. Just edit `main.rb` and put your API key, CSE ID and the amount of queries you wanna do. Then, have fun.

>But I don't know how I get this shit, man!!!

Woah, bro. It's actually pretty easy. Just go to https://cse.google.com/manage/all click **Add**, put whatever you want at this page and create it. Then, go back to the link, edit your newly created Google-Shit &trade;, set the Image Search to **On**, make it **Search the whole web**, save this shit and click at "Search Engine ID". Done, brah.
Actually, no. Go to https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview and click **Get a Key**. Do as you please.

>And how do I run it?

Install the dependencies and `ruby main.rb` at your chosen terminal/command prompt, I think? IDK

## Whoa, that's nice. Is it ready yet?

Nah. Time is short and I'm tired as potato. I have a short to-do list, though:

- [ ] Come up with a new way to ignore those stupid websites that gives me trouble
- [ ] Get API key, CSE ID and queries from ARGV
- [ ] Solve some problem with mechanize and UTF-8 that I can't debug right now because API usage
- [ ] Make it faster (somehow?)
- [ ] Sleep more
- [ ] Be a better person
- [ ] Stop coding shit like this
